The soma measures from 12 to 17 micrometers in its widest axis and is nearly spherical, having a rather smooth profile. The soma issues two or three short primary dendrites, which usually run horizontally. After a short distance (10 to 40 micrometers), these proximal branches give rise to sets of two to five long, secondary dendrites. The occurrence of third to order dendrites is variable, as is their length (20 to 150 micrometers). A defining characteristic of BN dendrites is the presence of distinct varicosities that are virtually devoid of dendritic spines.  The BN axon and its collaterals also exhibit a series of small spherules (0.3-0.5 um) united by thin axonal bridges (Lariva-Sahd, 2006, as reported in  http://brancusi.usc.edu/bkms)." []

The restriction of the piriform cell somata to the boundary between the zone of horizontal cells and the zone of vertical cells is remarkably accurate and consistent. The piriform cells give rise to 2 to 5 dendrites from the superficial surface, which course through the zone of horizontal cells to terminate just beneath the surface. As the ascending dendrites approach the surface they branch more frequently, almost always by equipartition, to form a complicated intermingling bouquet of slowly tapering dendrites, 150 to 350 micrometers in width and slightly less than 200 micrometers in depth. The axon most frequently takes its origin from the base of the soma, but sometimes it arises from one of the low order dendrites. From its origin the axon runs immediately down through the zone of vertical cells, occasionally with collaterals which may arborize within the superficial laminae.

The dendritic field is narrow and cylindrical, 100 to 250 micrometer in diameter, and extends from the upper margin of the zone of horizontal cells to the lower margin of the zone of vertical cells, about 500 micrometers. Rather than having superficial and deep fields, the pyramidal cell has the deep field reduced to a circumsomatic field, or a diminuitive basal field, and the superficial field is relatively elongated to accord with the deeper cell body. Pyramidal cells are usually multipolar, with one or two thick apical dendrites, which branch several times on the way to the surface, particularly in the upper portion of the zone of horizontal cells, and several smaller dendrites which form a small field about the cell body. It is of interest that smooth pyramidal cells tend to have two primary dendrites, like smooth vertical fusiform cells.

The dendrites may range anywhere from gnarled to radiate with the gnarled spiny cells most frequent in the zone of horizontal cells and the smooth radiate cells increasingly more frequent in the deeper zones until they are almost the only cell type in the zones below the stratum opticum. The dimensions of the cell bodies and dendritic fields are comparable to those of other cells in the same zone and the dendritic field is generally contained within the same zone as the cell body.

Cajal called these the ovoid or triangular cells. The second population has its cell bodies distributed primarily to the upper portion of the zone of optic fibers. Cajal called these triangular or stellate cells. Cajal's nomenclature is rather bulky and, though descriptive, somewhat confusing because stellate cells are a distinct cell type in the nomenclature of this paper and triangular occurs in both names. For reasons developed below, the ovoid or triangular cells or wide field cells of the zone of vertical cells will be called Type II ganglion cells and the triangular or stellate cells or wide field cells of the zone of optic fibers will be called Type III ganglion cells. Type I ganglion cells are the piriform cells. Collator note: we assumed this class of neurons as projection neurons, because at least several subpopulations project to visually related areas.

There is consensus that homologous elements are present in the non-primate neocortex, where their morphology is much simpler, as initially described in 1891 by Cajal (Fig. 2) (Cajal, 1891). \\nThe definition of these cells has remained somewhat confusing, in part because Cajal and Retzius studied different species and different developmental stages, and also because their original publications have not been generally available. Meyer et al (1999)prefer to define 'Cajal\\u2013Retzius cells' loosely, as the family of Reln-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the marginal zone, and reserve the term of pioneer neurons for the early, Reln-negative preplate derivatives that settle in the MZ and project to sub-cortical levels.

ITDs are the primary binaural cues for sound localization and segregation in humans and other low-frequency hearing vertebrates. While commonly used laboratory mammals such as mice and rats are high-frequency listeners and have a poorly developed MSO circuit, the structurally and functionally similar circuit in the chicken brainstem provides a particularly useful vertebrate model for basic research of ITD computation, due to its simple anatomy, well-characterized development and cell biology, and importantly, as a genetic tractable system."

The primary dendrites may derive from any portion of the cell body surface, but they usually arise from the dorsal or lateral surfaces. The dendrites of Type II ganglion cells intermingle, giving them a dense arbor of dendrites that extend over large regions of the superior colliculus. The axon may originate from the cell body or a low order dendrite. It may project into the region superficial to the cell body (figs. 9, 14) or into the deep zones (fig. 15). The axon of the superficial projection is similar to other intrinsic axons except for being thicker. It branches frequently to form an arbor approximately as wide as the dendritic field, which it overlaps, but they are not necessarily coincident, nor is one contained within the other." []

They differ in that some of their dendrites extend below the cell body and their cell bodies lie in the zone of optic fibers. The axon almost invariably runs down into the deep portion of the colliculus. Type III ganglion cells tend to have fewer, but thicker, dendrites passing through the first two zones than is usual for Type II ganglion cells. The dendrites are less spiny, branch less often, but like the other types of ganglion cells, they break up into many fine branches as they approach the surface, particularly in the upper portion of the zone of horizontal cells."

name: Vestibular type 1 hair cell
def: "A mechanoreceptor hair cell located in the acoustic maculae and the semicircular canals that mediates the sense of balance, movement, and head position. The vestibular hair cells are connected to accessory structures in such a way that movements of the head displace their stereocilia. This influences the membrane potential of the cells which relay information about movements via the vestibular part of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem." []

def: "The Zoidberg Neuron is a name for a recently mapped Starburst Amacrine Cell. The name was chosen via EyeWire, a neural mapping 'game', to any player who completed over 100 cubes. Prior to the competition, the specific neuron was known as the 'n00b neuron' by EyeWirers. However, the name was soon officially dubbed as the 'Zoidberg Neuron' during YouTube Geek Week.   The name 'Zoidberg' is a reference to the Futurama character, Zoidberg." []
